The main objective of this project is to develop a
Data-Driven Employee Performance and
Retention Platform that provides actionable
insights into employee attrition risks,
performance trends, and personalized retention
strategies. Using data from the company's HR
systems, surveys, and feedback, the platform will
help HR teams anticipate employee challenges
and proactively intervene before attrition occurs.
